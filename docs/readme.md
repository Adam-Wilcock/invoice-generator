##Git:

Git is a source control system. It allows us to track all changes to a given code automatically.

Basic overview of how Git works:
```
1. Create a repository (project) with a git hosting tool (GitHub)
2. Copy/clone the repository to your local machine
3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" save the changes
4. Push the changes to your main branch
5. Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
6. "Pull" the changes to your local machine
7. Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
8. Open a "pull" request (propose the changes to the main branch)
9. Merge your branch to the main branch
```
